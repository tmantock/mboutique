# MBoutique

MBoutique is a full e-commerce website dedicated to selling delicious Macarons.

Note: This website does not take any form of payments. This website is purely for example purposes. There are far better and more secure services for making credit card transactions than a MySQL database.

I made this website to demonstrate and practice the knowledge I have gained on Front-End and Back-End technologies. I wanted to make a visually appealing website that was functional as well.

- This project features the LAMP stack.

- This website features a modern design and is inspired by Google's Material Design Philosophy.

- MBoutique utilizes core Javascript and Angular JS to handle the Front-End logic for the application, like retrieving shopping information, handling date related items, adding and removing items within the cart, sharing pertinent data across all pages, sending the cart to the Back-End, verifying user input, and sending customer data to the Back-End.

- PHP and MySQL were used for the Back End of this project. MySQL was used to store all product and customer information. PHP was used to interface with MySQL and send pertinent data to the client via APIs. PHP and MySQL were also used to establish an OAUTH Token login system for customer logins.

- The inputs are validated through Regular Expressions on the HTML, inside of Javascript, and on the Back-End.

- The website is hosted on an Apache server on Ubuntu (Linux) hosted on an Amazon Web Services EC2 virtual machine.

- CSS3, Bootstrap Paper, and Material Design Lite were used to style the website.

- HTML5 was used as the markup language.

Please visit the website and please use it! You can go through the checkout process. It's fully functional! Please "purchase" some macarons (no payment required). The more orders, the more data I have to use for a later project. Thank You!
